# Welcome!

This is my first blog post. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Deep dives into projects I'm working on, tutorials, and insights
- **Engineering**: Best practices, tools, and techniques I find useful
- **Learning Journey**: Books I'm reading, courses I'm taking, and lessons learned

## A Quick Introduction

I recently graduated from Istanbul Technical University with a degree in AI and Data Engineering. I'm passionate about NLP, LLMs, and building intelligent systems that solve real problems.

I believe writing is a powerful tool for solidifying knowledge, and I hope these posts will be valuable to others as well.
